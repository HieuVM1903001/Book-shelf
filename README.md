Bookshelf WebApp
Introduction
Bookshelf is a web application built with React.js that allows users to manage their reading lists. Users can search for books, categorize them into different shelves like "Currently Reading," "Want to Read," and "Read," and maintain the state of their bookshelf even after page refreshes using local storage.

Features
Search Books: Search for books by title or author.
Categorize Books: Move books between shelves: "Currently Reading," "Want to Read," "Read," and "None."
Persistent State: Bookshelf state is stored in local storage to maintain the list after page refresh.
Responsive Design: The application is responsive and works on various screen sizes.
